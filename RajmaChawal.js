//DUE TO SOME PROBLEMS THIS IS THE RECIPE OF DOSA\

//Blend 2 cups of leftover rice, 1 cup of suji/semolina and 1/2 cup of curd. Whisk the mixture well and pour water to a smooth dosa batter. Leave aside for 15 minutes. Make dosas by stuffing grated paneer, beetroot, green chillies, coriander leaves, onion and carrot. Drizzle some ghee over it and serve crispy dosas. üòç
